                    <h3>Gas Sensor PCB</h3>
                    <p>
                        Myself and two other students were tasked with designing a sensing module to capture some data from the environment. We decided to build
                        a sensing board to detect harmful gasses present in the environment ,and provide warning to the users if any harmful gas reaches a dangerous
                        level.

                    <h3>Acoustic Triangulation using Time Difference of Arrival</h3>
                    <p>
                        As a team of 3, we were tasked with building a system that could accurately triangulate an audio source on a square grid using two
                        Raspberry Pi's along with 4 Ada Fruit microphones. The hardware configuration for this task was minimal - the difficulty came in 
                        synchronising the recordings from the different sets of microphones and capturing data of a high enough quality to send to our
                        Time Delay of Arrical algorithm to produce accurate results

                    <p>
                        In my design project in my first semester of fourth year, I was responsible for creating an interface through which users could interact with a 
                        smart bird scale (designed by the rest of my team). I used React JS to build a clean, modern Web Application capable of remotely receiving data from the
                        bird scale, displaying this neatly to the user and providing filtering options so users could select only certain data to view.

                    <h3>Naartjie: Split Payments Using Interledger's Open Payments Protocol</h3>
                    <p>
                        As part of a Hackathon hosted by Interledger at UCT, my team and I developed a split payments system to allow for seamlessly sending
                        money from one or more, to one or more, people. This 'many-to-many' payment system has two main use cases. Firstly, splitting the cost
                        of an item between a group of people, without one person having to pay the lump sum. For example, it would allow a group of people
                        splitting a product on an ecommerce site to pay only for their share. The second big benefit is sending money to multiple receivers.
                        This is particularly useful in situations where an ecommerce vendor is repaying a loan. Our system allows for each individual payment
                        made to the vendor, to be automatically split such that the vendor receives a certain percentage, and a small percentage is sent immediately
                        to the vendor's supplier

                    <h3>Low Cost Generic FOTA for IoT Devices (In Progress)</h3>
                    <p>
                        For my final year Research Project, I am working on a FOTA (Firmware Over the Air) System to be used by Internet of Things devices.
                        This project works with the Zephyr RTOS to allow for wireless firmware updates for devices deployed in the field to take place seamlessly, securely
                        and with minimal power consumption. The goal is to ensure that these updates can be rolled out to all relevant devices - regardless of their
                        hardware architecture.

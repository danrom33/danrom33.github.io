            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                I am a hardworking, passionate final year Electrical and Computer Engineering Student. My love of problem solving, along with my strong
                curiosity, are the foundations on which my engineering identity is built. 
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Out of all the knowledge I have acquired thrughout the four years of my degree - I believe that two of them stand out as the most important 
                skills obtained. These are skills that I am going to carry forward with me in my future career as an engineer and they are:
            </p>
            <br/>
            <ol>
                <li><p>The ability to look at a complex, overhwlemingingly large problem and logically break it down into small, manageable subsystems and tasks</p></li>
                <li><p>The skill of independant research and learning</p></li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            <p>
                As I approach the end of my undergraduate degree and begin looking towards entering the working world, I know that having gained these two important
                skills I am equipped with all I need to handle any problems I am given, as well as continue my growth and development as an engineer

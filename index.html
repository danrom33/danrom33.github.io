                    <h3>Gas Sensor PCB</h3>
                    <p>
                        Myself and two other students were tasked with designing a sensing module to capture some data from the environment. We decided to build
                        a sensing board to detect harmful gasses present in the environment ,and provide warning to the users if any harmful gas reaches a dangerous
                        level.

                    <h3>Acoustic Triangulation using Time Difference of Arrival</h3>
                    <p>
                        As a team of 3, we were tasked with building a system that could accurately triangulate an audio source on a square grid using two
                        Raspberry Pi's along with 4 Ada Fruit microphones. The hardware configuration for this task was minimal - the difficulty came in 
                        synchronising the recordings from the different sets of microphones and capturing data of a high enough quality to send to our
                        Time Delay of Arrical algorithm to produce accurate results

                    <h3>Web Application for a Smart Bird Scale</h3>
                    <p>
                        In my design project in my first semester of fourth year, I was responsible for creating an interface through which users could interact with a 
                        smart bird scale (designed by the rest of my team). I used React JS to build a clean, modern Web Application capable of remotely receiving data from the
                        bird scale, displaying this neatly to the user and providing filtering options so users could select only certain data to view.
